## Purpose

Compare activity mitigator values selected by schemes within the New Hospital Programme (NHP) modelling process.

## Content

From the navigation bar above you can visit the:

-   'Information' tab (current tab), which provides background information and instructions
-   'Point-ranges' tab, which shows a plot of the selected schemes' the percentage range and midpoint for the selected mitigators
-   'Heatmap' tab, which colours the upper, lower, midpoint and range values of the percentage range selections made by the selected schemes, as well as a binary version to indicate simply whether a mitigator was submitted or not
-   'Data' tab, which presents the full underlying data and lookups for schemes and mitigators

## Mitigator values

### Labels

-   The scenarios presented in this app are the ones each scheme has identified as the 'final' one used in their outputs report.
-   The scheme labelled '[focal]' is the one you have selected as the focal scheme in the left-hand panel.

### 80% prediction interval

-   Schemes were asked to select mitigators in the NHP Inputs app and to provide an 80% prediction interval (a lower and upper value) for the expected reduction in activity by their chosen horizon (final) year.
-   A value of 100% assumes no reduction in activity, while a value of 0 assumes a total (100%) reduction.
-   For example, a scheme may select 70 to 90% as their interval, from which we can define a midpoint of 80%. These are the values represented in the point-range and heatmap charts.
-   In some cases, schemes have made a point estimate rather than a range.
-   For reference purposes, the point-range charts also include the results of the National Elicitation Exercise (NEE), but note that some mitigators were not part of that exercise. NEE predictions were for 2039/40.

### Percent of activity mitigated

-   The inverse of the 80% prediction interval is the proportion of activity mitigated against.
-   A value of 100% assumes all activity is reduced, while a value of 0 assumes zero (0%) reduction.
