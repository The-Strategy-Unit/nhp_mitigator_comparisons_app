## Purpose

Compare activity mitigator values selected by schemes within the New Hospital Programme (NHP) modelling process.

## Content

From the navigation bar above you can visit the:

-   'Information' tab (current tab), which provides background information and instructions
-   'Prediction Intervals' tab, which shows a plot of the selected schemes' prediction interval and its midpoint for each of the selected mitigators
-   'Heatmap' tab, which allows comparison by colour across summaries of the focal scheme's prediction intervals
-   'Data' tab, which presents the full underlying data and lookups for schemes and mitigators

## Mitigator values

### Labels

-   The scenarios presented in this app are the ones each scheme has identified as the 'final' one used in their outputs report.
-   Schemes labelled as '[preliminary]' have not yet identified a 'final' scenario but have identified one as an 'initial' or 'intermediate' scenarios.
-   The scheme labelled '[focal]' is the one you have selected as the focal scheme in the left-hand panel.

### 80% prediction interval

-   Schemes were asked to select mitigators in [the NHP Inputs app](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/inputs/) and to provide an 80% prediction interval (a lower and upper value) for the expected reduction in activity by their chosen horizon (final) year.
-   A value of 100% assumes no reduction in activity, while a value of 0 assumes a total (100%) reduction.
-   For example, a scheme may select 70 to 90% as their interval, from which we can define a midpoint of 80%. These are the values represented in the prediction-interval and heatmap charts.
-   In some cases, schemes have selected erroneously a point estimate (i.e. the same value was chosen for the low and high end of the interval) rather than a true interval.
-   For reference purposes, the prediction-interval charts also include the results of [the National Elicitation Exercise (NEE)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-084632), but note that some mitigators were not part of that exercise. NEE predictions were for 2039/40.

### Percent of activity mitigated

-   The inverse of the 80% prediction interval is the proportion of activity mitigated against.
-   A value of 100% assumes all activity is reduced, while a value of 0 assumes zero (0%) reduction.
