## Purpose

Compare assumptions about future activity rates for **types of potentially mitigable activity (TPMAs)** selected by schemes within the New Hospital Programme (NHP) modelling process.

### **Warning about making direct comparisons!**
<span style="color:red">**Please be aware that schemes have made assumptions about activity mitigation based on local knowledge of
specific patient populations and case mix, current plans, risk appetite and other factors.
Be wary of making direct comparisons between different schemes' assumptions as,
due to these factors and more, they may not be valid in all cases, even when plots are standardized.**</span>

## Content

From the navigation bar above you can visit the:

-   'Information' tab (current tab), which provides background information and instructions
-   'Prediction Intervals' tab, which shows a plot of the selected schemes' prediction interval and its midpoint for each of the selected TMPAs
-   'Heatmap' tab, which allows comparison by colour across summaries of the focal scheme's prediction intervals
-   'Data' tab, which presents the full underlying data and lookups for schemes and TPMAs

## TPMA assumption values

### Labels

-   The scenarios presented in this app are the ones each scheme has identified as the 'final' one used in their outputs report.
-   The scheme labelled '[focal]' is the one you have selected as the focal scheme in the left-hand panel.

### 80% prediction interval (how much of activity of this sort a scheme thinks they could plausibly still be providing in the horizon year)

-   Schemes were asked to select TPMAs in [the NHP Inputs app](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/inputs/) and to provide an 80% prediction interval (a lower and upper value) for the expected reduction in activity by their chosen horizon (final) year.
-   **A value of 100% assumes no reduction in activity, while a value of 0 assumes a total (100%) reduction.**
-   For example, a scheme may select 70 to 90% as their interval, from which we can define a midpoint of 80%. These are the values represented in the prediction-interval and heatmap charts.
-   In some cases, schemes have selected erroneously a point estimate (i.e. the same value was chosen for the low and high end of the interval) rather than a true interval.
-   For reference purposes, the prediction-interval charts also include the results of [the National Elicitation Exercise (NEE)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-084632), but note that some TPMAs were not part of that exercise. NEE predictions were for 2039/40.

### Percent of activity mitigated (how much of the baseline activity a scheme thinks they will no longer be providing in the horizon year)

-   The '80% prediction interval' is how much activity of this sort a scheme thinks they will plausibly still provide in the horizon year. 
The 'percent of activity mitigated' is the opposite of this, i.e. what proportion of this activity will **not** be provided in the horizon year.
-   A value of 100% assumes this activity will no longer be provided at all, while a value of 0 assumes there will be no reduction compared to the baseline year.
