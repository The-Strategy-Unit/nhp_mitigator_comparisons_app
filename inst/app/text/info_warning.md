Please be aware that schemes have made assumptions about activity mitigation based on local knowledge of specific patient populations and case mix, current plans, risk appetite and other factors.

Be wary of making direct comparisons between different schemes' assumptions as, due to these factors and more, they may not be valid in all cases, even when plots are standardised.
