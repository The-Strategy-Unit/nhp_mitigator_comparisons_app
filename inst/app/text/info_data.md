Scenario selection

* The data presented in this app originates from model scenarios identified by each scheme as the 'final' one used in their outputs report.
* The results of [the National Elicitation Exercise (NEE)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-084632) (expert predictions for 2039/40) are presented in the app for reference, but note that some TPMAs were not part of that exercise.
* Data were recorded in [the NHP Inputs app](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/inputs/) as 80% prediction intervals (a lower and upper value) for a chosen horizon (final) year, but you can choose to view the data here as the percent of activity mitigated instead.

The 80% prediction interval:

* tells us how much activity of this type that a scheme thinks they could plausibly still be providing in the horizon year
* is a scale from 0 (i.e. a total reduction in all activity) to 100% (i.e. no reduction in activity at all)

The percent of activity mitigated:

* tells us how much of the baseline activity a scheme thinks they will no longer be providing in the horizon year
* is the inversion of the 80% prediction interval, so a value of 100% assumes this activity will no longer be provided at all, while a value of 0 assumes there will be no reduction compared to the baseline year

Note that:

* this app presents interval 'midpoints', e.g. an interval of 70 to 90% has a midpoint of 80%
* in some cases, schemes may have selected erroneously a point estimate (i.e. the same value was chosen for the low and high end of the interval) rather than an interval
