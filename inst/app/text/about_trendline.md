These visualisations provide a time line of the focal scheme's historic activity rates with the ability to compare against other schemes' historical activity and / or the focal scheme's predicted activity at the horizon year.

Please note, types of potentially mitigable activity (TPMAs) are limited to those where there is historical data for the focal scheme.

Use these to compare each scheme's ambitions relative to their historic performance.

#### Structure

TPMAs are listed in separate plots, with years on the x-axes and the y-axis showing the schemes' historical activity.

Hovering the lines reveals contextual information such as scheme name and code, the year and rate of activity.

Click the plot's camera icon to download a copy of the plot as a high quality image (scalable vector graphic).

#### Data Availability

Note that schemes and TPMAs will not be plotted if there is no data to show.
Schemes may have chosen not to set a TPMA, or a TPMA [may not have been available](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/user_guide/mitigators_lookup.html) when developing a scenario.

#### Settings

##### Show other schemes?

Toggle this option to show trend lines of historic activity for other schemes as grey lines.
Hovering over the lines reveals contextual information such as scheme name and code, the year and rate of activity.

This is useful to compare the observed trend in the focal scheme's activity with other schemes.

Note that other schemes' data won't be plotted if there is no data to show.

##### Show horizon on timeline?

Toggle this option to see the focal scheme's estimated activity at the horizon year, represented by a dot for the middle point with 10% and 90% interval shown as whiskers.
Dotted lines run from the baseline year to the horizon year to illustrate the expected change.

Hovering over the point-range reveals contextual information such as the horizon year, the rate of activity expected and the z-scores for these.

Z-scores show how many standard deviations difference there is for the horizon activity when compared with the average historical activity leading up to the baseline year.
Scores greater than 2 or less than -2 are indicative of substantial change.

This is useful to see the estimated activity at the horizon year with reference to the baseline year and the rate of change required.

##### Show horizon as overlay?

Toggle this option to see the focal scheme's estimated activity at the horizon year represented by a band of three lines for the 10%, 50% and 90% estimates across the plot.

This can be used on its own to overlay historic performance over the expected activity at the horizon year, or alternatively, alongside the `Show horizon on timeline` to visualise the expected activity alongside historic performance throughout the historic and future time periods.

This is useful to see estimated activity at the horizon year alongside historic performance.

##### Show pre-baseline average?

Toggle this option to see the focal scheme's average activity up to and including the baseline year along with a window of two standard deviations above and below.

This is useful to see the range of values expected based on historic performance.
Used in conjunction with `Show horizon as overlay` this option can illustrate the z-scores, such that horizon values above or below this range are indicative of substantial change.

##### Plot height

Use the slider to specify a height for each plot. The default is 400 pixels but this slider allows you to set this as low as 250 pixels for a condensed view or as high as 600 pixels for better clarity.

This is useful where schemes are clustered and you would like to see the plots in more detail.
