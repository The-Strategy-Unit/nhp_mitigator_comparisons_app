#### Purpose

Use this section to ask:

> "How many types of potentially mitigatable activity have schemes submitted?"

This table shows the proportion of types of potentially mitigatable activity (TPMAs) in use by each scheme.

Use this view to see the proportion of available TPMAs that have been selected by schemes.

#### Structure

Schemes are listed in each row of the table. The last two columns show the percentage coverage by:

1.  All TPMAs available in the data.
2.  The selected TPMAs in the 'TPMAs to visualise' setting.

The focal scheme is highlighted in red and the schemes selected to visualise are shown in bold.
