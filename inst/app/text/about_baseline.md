#### Purpose

Use this section to ask:

> "Have we set ambitious assumptions compared to our baseline activity rates?"

These provide a scatter plot view of scheme's Types of Potentially-Mitigatable Activity (TPMA) ambitions against their baseline rates.

Use these to compare each scheme's ambitions relative to their baseline rate.

#### Structure

TPMAs are shown in separate plots, with baseline rates across the x-axes and the y-axis showing the scheme's ambitions for each TPMA, shown as either 80% prediction interval or the percent of activity mitigated depending on your preferred view.

Overlaying the plots are dotted lines indicating the mean scheme values, dividing the plot into four quadrants:

* left-right: low to high baseline
* bottom-top: high mitigation/low prediction to low mitigation/high prediction (depending on your preferred view)

Hovering each point reveals contextual information such as scheme name and code, percent mitigated/predicted, baseline rate and year and a textual description of the quadrant the scheme falls within.

Click the plot's camera icon to download a copy of the plot as a high quality image (scalable vector graphic).

#### Data Availability

Note that schemes and TPMAs will not be plotted if there is no data to show.
Schemes may have chosen not to set a TPMA, or a TPMA [may not have been available](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/user_guide/mitigators_lookup.html) when developing a scenario.

#### Settings

##### Show 80% interval?

Toggle this option to show or hide the 80% interval between low and high points for each scheme.

These are useful to see how variable the scheme's estimate is.

##### Show quadrant lines?

Toggle this option to show or hide dotted lines dividing the plot into quadrants.
Each line is the average (mean) value of all schemes' results for that TPMA.

This is useful to see which schemes fall into each quadrant, such as high baseline and high reduction.

##### Show scheme codes?

Toggle this option to show or hide labels in the plot showing each scheme's code.

This is useful if you wish to save the plot as a static image and would like to distinguish each scheme.

##### Plot height

Use the slider to specify a height for each plot.
The default is 250 pixels but this slider allows you to set this as low as 150 pixels for a condensed view or as high as 400 pixels for better clarity.

This is useful where schemes are clustered and you would like to see the plots in more detail.
