#### Purpose 

Use this section to ask:

> "How many schemes have submitted assumptions for this type of activity?"

This table shows the proportion of schemes that have provided responses for each selected Type of Potentially-Mitigatable Activity (TPMA).

Use this view to see which of the selected TPMAs are more commonly used across schemes.

#### Structure

TPMAs are listed in each row of the table along with their groupings.

The last two columns show the percentage coverage by:

1.  All schemes available in the data.
2.  The schemes selected in the 'Schemes to visualise' setting.
