Point-range plots show ranges and midpoints estimated by schemes for their selected mitigators.

Use these plots to compare and contrast schemes' estimated predictions for mitigators.

#### Structure

Schemes are listed alphabetically on the y-axis by default and either the 80% prediction-interval or the percent of activity mitigated is shown on the x-axis.

Separate plots are provided for each of your selected mitigators.

Plots are placed in 'columns' horizontally and repeated on several vertical 'rows' as required.
You can control the number of plots per row using the 'Number of charts per row' slider control in the settings sidebar.

Responses for the *Focal scheme* are highlighted in red.

#### Data Availability

Note that schemes and mitigators will not be plotted if there is no data to show.
Schemes may have chosen not to set a mitigator, or a mitigator [may not have been available](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/user_guide/mitigators_lookup.html) when developing a scenario.

#### Settings

##### Standardise by horizon length

The 80% prediction-interval ranges are estimates for reduced activity by a chosen horizon year. The percent of activity mitigated are the inverse - an estimate for how much activity is mitigated against by the chosen horizon year.

Schemes have chosen different horizon years, which may explain some of the variation between schemes.

To compare the change **per year** you can enable this option to better compare schemes.

##### Show mitigator code

Enable this option to switch between mitigator names and the mitigator codes.

Using mitigator codes is useful if horizontal space is limited.

##### One chart per scheme

Enable this option to show separate plots for each scheme, with the mitigators listed on the y-axis.

These plots are a helpful way to scan responses for each scheme.

##### Show NEE range

Enable this option to see the range of values suggested from [the National Elicitation Exercise (NEE)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-084632) as bars.

These are useful aid to check if values are within the ranges suggested by national experts.

Bars won't appear if a mitigator wasn't part of the NEE exercise.

##### Number of charts per row

Use the slider to control the number of plots shown side-by-side across each row.

##### Summary

Enable this option to see an aggregate summary of selected schemes' responses (except the focal scheme).

This is useful to compare the focal scheme with an aggregate summary of the other schemes' responses.

Enable the *Range (selected schemes)* option to see the extreme upper and lower values for the ranges.
