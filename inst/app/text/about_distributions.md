These illustrate the combined distributions of all schemes' responses as either a density plot (PDF) or a cumulative density plot (ECDF).

Use these to compare the focal scheme's response against an amalgam of all other schemes' responses.

NB, point-estimates (prediction intervals with the same low and high values) are removed from the data when constructing these distributions.

#### Structure

Mitigators are shown in separate plots, with either the 80% prediction interval or the percent of activity mitigated, on the x-axes and the y-axis showing the density of the mixture distribution.

Overlaying the plots are dotted lines indicating the 80% range between low and high values for the overall distributions, highlighted in turquoise, and a dashed line indicating the mid point.

The focal scheme's 80% prediction interval or percent of activity mitigated is shown as a point-range plot.

Plots with a narrow bell-shaped curve indicate alignment in how schemes have responded to this mitigator.

Plots with multiple peaks or very wide prediction intervals indicate variation in schemes' responses.

#### Data Availability

Note that schemes and mitigators will not be plotted if there is no data to show.
Schemes may have chosen not to set a mitigator, or a mitigator [may not have been available](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/user_guide/mitigators_lookup.html) when developing a scenario.

#### Settings

##### Show ECDF?

Toggle this option to switch between the density plot and the cumulative density plot.

These are useful to simplify complex, multi-peak distributions to a smoother line.

##### Show NEE interval?

Enable this option to see the range of values suggested from [the National Elicitation Exercise (NEE)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-084632) as bars.

These are useful aid to check if values are within the ranges suggested by national experts.

Bars won't appear if a mitigator wasn't part of the NEE exercise.
